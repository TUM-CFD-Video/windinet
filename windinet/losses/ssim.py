"""
Structural Similarity (SSIM) loss.

Expected input:
    pred, target: [B, C, T, H, W], normalized to [-1, 1] (the dataset's
    clipped z-score, windinet.training.shockwave_data.normalize_fields).

Returns:
    1 - SSIM

SSIM assumes non-negative intensities with a known data range: its
luminance term (2*mu_x*mu_y + C1) / (mu_x^2 + mu_y^2 + C1) is only well
behaved when the local means are positive. Our fields are signed and mostly
close to 0 (the momentum channels especially), so on the raw [-1, 1] values
that term flips sign and blows up wherever a local mean sits near zero, and
it dominated the loss gradient (Chapter 6 Group 2: adding SSIM made val SSIM
itself worse). Inputs are therefore shifted to [0, 1] first, with
data_range = 1 and the standard C1 = (0.01)^2, C2 = (0.03)^2. The Gaussian
window is applied without padding ("valid"), as in the reference
implementation, so zero padding cannot create fake edges at the border.
